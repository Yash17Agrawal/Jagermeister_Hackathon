This android application has been made as a solution to multiple health related issues in our present society.<br>
As we often see there are many instances where we see dumps of wastes lying carelessly, ponds of stagnationg water with dangerous diseases unaddressed<br>
by govt. where our app comes in handy by which a user can enter the details of type of issue and post in twitter where we will take care of sending the issue to respective governmental organisations.<br>

Our app may be seen as a helping hand for the old peple in need who at times face difficulty in finding their neccessary medicines, with our app people can click picture of the of the printed prescription of a doctor which with the help of OCR technique will send the output text to a associated chat application which will have chemists as its memeber.
so whenever a name of medicine is posted on chat  the chemist who want to promote his shop or has the medicine can send or inform the people of the availabilty.

Only getting medicine in vicinity is not the only issue we have, often at time of emergencies as of serious road accidents or sudden ailment we dont have proper communication between user and hospitals,
here is where our app can play a vital role.Basically what happens here is that when a user enters a sentence indicating requirement of an ambulance (nlp parsing ) our system takes his current position or the one mentioned in the sentenece and checks if pick and drop locations are valid , and if it turns out to be a genuine request a nearest cab provider will be able to communicate with the user in need.
